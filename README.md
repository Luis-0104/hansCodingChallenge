# Coding challenge

## General

Your task is to create a simple web-based interface for managing users.  Users have to be saved in a relational database. Please use the following technologies for creating the app:

For front-end:
* HTML
* CSS, SCSS/SASS or less
* react + redux or mobX

For back-end:
* nodejs
* MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Optional: docker(-compose)

Please use a REST-based API for communication between front- and back-end. An authentication system (login form, logout) is not part of the task. The app should contain several pages, described in the next sections. You are free to design an appropriate database schema.

After you have completed the task, please send us a zip file with your source code, an SQL dump and a README file with instructions on how to run the project. Finally you should present your implementation within 15 minutes.

Good luck!

## Pages

There should also be a search form for finding users by a certain keyword in fields: customer number, user name, first name, last name and email address
